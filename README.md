Copied some of his code, modified it, changed certain perameters, added some of my own ideas, etc.

## Future Modifications

I would like to:
- Go back through the code and comment the code properly.
- Clean the VS code up by adding folders.
- Edit the SVG print out so it is indented onto the webpage better. Just to look more appealing.
